# Climate_News_Scraper_ETL
Using this project one is capable of scraping the [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56837908) website for the latest updates on climate. The scraper functionality is packed in an ETL pipeline build on Prefect and Dask in order to load the scraped news articles in a SQL Lite database.
